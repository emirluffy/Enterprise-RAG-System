# Product Context - Enterprise RAG System

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Enterprise organizations are drowning in documents. Critical knowledge is trapped in:
- Hundreds of PDF manuals and procedures
- Scattered departmental documentation
- Training materials across multiple systems
- Regulatory documents and compliance guides
- Historical decision records and policies

**Current Pain Points:**
- Employees waste 2.5 hours daily searching for information
- Call center agents put customers on hold while searching PDFs
- New hires take weeks to find basic procedural information
- Critical knowledge disappears when experts leave
- Same questions get asked repeatedly across departments

### The Opportunity
Transform passive document libraries into active knowledge assistants that understand context and provide instant, accurate answers with source citations.
