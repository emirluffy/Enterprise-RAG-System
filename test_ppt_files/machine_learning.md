# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of ML
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through rewards and penalties

## Popular Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest

## Tools and Libraries
- Python: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- R: caret, randomForest
- Java: Weka, DL4J

## Best Practices
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model validation and testing
- Avoiding overfitting
